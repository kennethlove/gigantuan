        <h2>Person</h2>
        <p>I'm Kenneth Love, a web developer and occassional web designer. I like to <a href="http://gettingstartedwithdjango.com">teach</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kennethlove/kl_dotfiles">I'm constantly perfecting</a>.</p>
        <p>I'm a huge fan of documentation, polyglotism, and <a href="http://forrstpodcast.com">strong opinions</a>. I'm also a big believer in open source, both at <a href="https://github.com/kennethlove">Github</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/kennethlove">Bitbucket</a>.</p>
        <p>I'm also a husband, father, and hardline skeptic.</p>
        <p>I have an <strong>Associates of Applied Sciences</strong> degree from <strong>Oklahoma State University, Okmulgee</strong> for <strong>Multimedia Design</strong>, and about 15 years of experience on the web, both amateur and professional.</p>
        <p>I've worked a few different places, including <strong>Brick</strong> (as a contract web developer), <strong>Mercantila</strong> (as a software engineer), and <strong>SK+G Advertising</strong> (as an interactive developer). I've also been successfully freelancing continuously since 2009. I did it off of and on before then, too.</p>
        <p>I do most of my work nowadays with my friend Chris Jones at our semi-sort-of startup <strong><a href="http://brack3t.com">Brack3t</a></strong> or on my own as my own company, <strong>Gigantuan</strong> (Who would've guessed?).</p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>Pretty much everything I do is in <a href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a>. I'm do a lot of front-end work as well, all of which adheres to modern web standards as much as possible.</p>

            <li>PHP</li>
            <li>XML</li>
            <li>JSON</li>
